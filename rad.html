          <h2>RAD Remedy</h2>
          <p>RAD Remedy is an open source project that is creating a healthcare tool that can connect transgender and other gender-nonconforming individuals to healthcare resources based on their location. The end product is a Yelp-like web application which hopes to become operational in the first half of 2015. I joined up with the team in July 2014, after the initial design work had already been completed. I work mostly as a front end developer, but I am attempting to interject as many user-centered design principles as possible by educating the rest of the team on why they are important. </p>
          <p>My most successful task at this point was the creation of personas for the project. I worked with the Director of Operations to go through the results of the survey they had sent out to potential users to distill who their distinct user groups are. From there, we divded the groups into primary and secondary user groups, which I turned into 5 personas. They can be viewed here.</p>
          <p>Over the next few months, I hope to continue educating the team about user-centered design principles. When the site releases it's first beta, I hope to do some remote usability testing, but this is still in the development process. </p>
