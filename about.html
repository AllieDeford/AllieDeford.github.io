          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>When I graduated from the University of Evansville in May of 2014 with a degree in Computer Science, I knew that I wanted to shift my focus from strict software development to something that could help other people. While in school, I worked extensively with UE PRIDE, a diversity organization that focused on providing support to LGBTQ and other students who simply needed a place to belong on campus. I acted as the webmaster for two years, and each time someone mentioned that they had found us through the website, or reached out through email because of information that had found online, I felt so good. The website was not the mostly technically complicated site I had ever worked on-- far from it. But it was being useful and helpful to others, and that ignited my passion for combining technology and people's needs.</p>
          <p>The first time I realized I could turn that passion into an actual career outside of pure development was when my Anthropology professor sent me a link to an article that he had read about using ethnographic techniques in software development; I used that article as a jumping off place to learn more about the field of User Research. My research led me to look into graduate school. I eventually applied and was accepted to the University of Washington's Human Centered Design and Engineering master's program, where I am currently studying. At the moment, I think I want to focus on UX Research, but I am trying to also gain experience in UX Design to make sure that I prefer research.</p>
          <p>If you have any further questions or want to get to know me more, please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> or view my <a href="resources/resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
